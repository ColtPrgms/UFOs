# UFOs
## Bootcamp Challenge 11 

#### Overview:
    Design a websites using HTML, Javascript, and CSS to provide information about UFOs and allowing users to filter existing data by 5 categories. 

#### Results:
    The completed search function is used by filling out one to five filter slots to parse through the table of data. Inside the input boxes show a template of what is needed from the user to use the search. See the images below as examples of using the search function.

#### Summary:
    A drawback of the website is that the input from user has to be formatted exactly. Adding a zero before any single digit month or capitalizing a city name will not send back any results. 

    Going forward, adding in code to correct users inputs to correct minor incorrect formatting. example being maing a users input of "Chicago" be read as "chicago" or '01/13/22" being read as "1/13/22".
    Another recommendation is another page where users can submit their own data following the format of the currect data in the table. While this information should be proofed before entered into the data file. This can allow the data to grow and be a great reference of possiable UFO sightings over the years.
